### Hi, I'm Ahsan!! ðŸ‘‹

<img align="right" src="../img/ahsan.jpg" height="200px">

I am a PhD student in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Ghulam Ishaq Khan (GIK) Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology Topi, Swabi](https://www.giki.edu.pk/) Pakistan. My research is supervised by  [Dr. Hadeed Ahmed Sher](https://www.giki.edu.pk/Faculty/Dr-Hadeed-Ahmed-Sher-Senior-Member-IEEE).


Keeping aside all the jargons, maths and information, I love to spend my leisure on reading about photography and experimenting with my camera.
